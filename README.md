# Python fake game

Simple console guessing game where the user guesses whether a randomly generated number is even or odd. 
If the player guesses correctly, they get a point. If they guess wrong, the PC gets a point.

But, the PC cheats (it's called "fake game" for a reason after all). 
If the player is in the lead, from time to time the computer will disregard the generated number altogether and just give itself a point anyway.
